        <div class="info">
            <p>Four years after American rising artist Gatton came out with the track When Scars Become Art, he didn’t expect that it would become a fan favorite here in the Philippines.
                The song became one of the fastest growing songs in the country after he uploaded a TikTok video of it last January. It immediately went viral with 5.4 million views, 664,000 likes, 6,441 comments and 900,000-plus user generated content videos using the audio and sparked the song’s incredible growth, as cited in the media release.
                He credited the newfound fame of the song to the concept itself, which is trying to “make art out of your scars and find beauty in every situation.""
                When Scars Become Art eventually became the “anthem of my life which is to cultivate art out of every scar and to choose resilience.” It kind of resonated with the audience because, “We all are trying to do that in some way. We are all trying to overcome our pain. And then (it is) something like making something beautiful and discovering a new found strength from the pain.”
